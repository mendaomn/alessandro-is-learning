### PROJECT: Coding a simple Automation Server

In the quest of understanding a bit better the world of Continuous Integration, I started wondering how would a simple CI work. 

What better way to learn something new than to get one's hands dirty and code an automation server from scratch!

In this project I'll be building:

 - an Automation Server, exposing RESTful endpoints to create and run pipelines
 - a Command Line Interface, acting as client, to make it easy to actually use the CI in a real project

### COURSE: Digging Into Node.js

by Kyle Simpson

Even if I've been using NodeJS since a couple of years now, I figured I never actually stopped and learned the hows and the whys of the Node platform. 

In this course, I've learned about Streams, handling stdin, stdout and stderr, creating a basic Command Line Interface and a lot of subtleties about what makes Node a very good platform for I/O

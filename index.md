## Coding the simplest PubSub in the world

**Type**: PROJECT

**Description**:

The PubSub is one of the first software patterns I implemented myself in JavaScript, and to this day I think it's so simple yet so important when it comes to keeping different parts of a Web Application in sync.

So here it's my take at it, heavily inspired by [mitt](https://github.com/developit/mitt)

## Coding the simplest State Manager in the world

**Type**: PROJECT

**Description**:

State Management is surely one of the most delicate aspects of building sizable Web Applications. 

Yet I think most of the state managers out there tend to overdo it, so I tried my hand at it with two goals in mind:

- it should only do what's absolutely needed
- it should be as small as possible

## Coding a simple Automation Server

**Type**: PROJECT

**Description**:

In the quest of understanding a bit better the world of Continuous Integration, I started wondering how would a simple CI work. 

What better way to learn something new than to get one's hands dirty and code an automation server from scratch!

In this project I'll be building:

 - an Automation Server, exposing RESTful endpoints to create and run pipelines
 - a Command Line Interface, acting as client, to make it easy to actually use the CI in a real project

## Digging Into Node.js

**Type**: COURSE 

**Description**:

Even if I've been using NodeJS since a couple of years now, I figured I never actually stopped and learned the hows and the whys of the Node platform. 

In this course, I've learned about Streams, handling stdin, stdout and stderr, creating a basic Command Line Interface and a lot of subtleties about what makes Node a very good platform for I/O

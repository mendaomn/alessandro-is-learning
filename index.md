## Advanced React Patterns

**Type**: COURSE 

**Description**:

Developing in React requires you to start thinking in terms of Components, and with that come new patterns that have been emerging, that help developers solve common problems.

In this course, I've learned a ton about how to think critically about the component I'm creating and its "surface" (or I allow users of that component to use it). Most importantly, I've learned quite a few handy patterns:

- Compound Components
- Render Prop Pattern
- Prop Collections Pattern, 
- Prop Getters Pattern, 
- State Initializer Pattern, 
- State Reducer Pattern
- Control Props (my absolute fav ✨✨)
- Provider Pattern
- Higher Order Components
- Rendux

## Coding the simplest Test Framework (and assertions) in the world

Inspired by [Kent C. Dodds testing-workshop](https://github.com/kentcdodds/testing-workshop), I've decided to code my own little test framework, mimicking the Jest API, in order to better understand how things work under the hood.

This project includes:

- `test` function
- `expect.toBe` and `expect.toEqual` assertions
- `spy` function to create a mocks and be able to assert on them

This has also been a great way to put some of the learnings from the [Creating an Open Source Javascript Library on Github](#creating-an-open-source-javascript-library-on-github) course into practice. 

Thus it's got git hooks, a linting and static type checking, coverage reports and it integrates with the Travis CI.

## Creating an Open Source JavaScript Library on Github

**Type**: COURSE 

**Description**:

Simply put, a goldmine of tips and instructions on how to properly setup and maintain an Open Source project. From choosing the LICENSE, to configure Travis CI to go through all the tests on new Pull Requests; from semantic-releases to creating a "universal" library that can be used on the browser, and with module loaders other than Webpack.

## Coding the simplest PubSub in the world

**Type**: PROJECT

**Description**:

The PubSub is one of the first software patterns I implemented myself in JavaScript, and to this day I think it's so simple yet so important when it comes to keeping different parts of a Web Application in sync.

So here it's my take at it, heavily inspired by [mitt](https://github.com/developit/mitt)

## Coding the simplest State Manager in the world

**Type**: PROJECT

**Description**:

State Management is surely one of the most delicate aspects of building sizable Web Applications. 

Yet I think most of the state managers out there tend to overdo it, so I tried my hand at it with two goals in mind:

- it should only do what's absolutely needed
- it should be as small as possible

## Coding a simple Automation Server

**Type**: PROJECT

**Description**:

In the quest of understanding a bit better the world of Continuous Integration, I started wondering how would a simple CI work. 

What better way to learn something new than to get one's hands dirty and code an automation server from scratch!

In this project I'll be building:

 - an Automation Server, exposing RESTful endpoints to create and run pipelines
 - a Command Line Interface, acting as client, to make it easy to actually use the CI in a real project

## Digging Into Node.js

**Type**: COURSE 

**Description**:

Even if I've been using NodeJS since a couple of years now, I figured I never actually stopped and learned the hows and the whys of the Node platform. 

In this course, I've learned about Streams, handling stdin, stdout and stderr, creating a basic Command Line Interface and a lot of subtleties about what makes Node a very good platform for I/O

## You Don't Know JS

**Type**: BOOK

**Description**:

I consider YDKJS the best book on the JavaScript.

I taught me most of what I know about the language and its uses; most importantly, it taught more than just notions: I learned about digging deeper and how to think critically about the language I'm using.

My approach towars programming in general changed after I've read this series of books, and I keep coming back to it when there's something I'm not sure about.
